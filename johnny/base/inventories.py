    The method we implement here avoids having to split rows for partial

    together:

      [+1, +1, -1, -1]

    Basically as long as there is a reduction against an existing position, the
    same match id is used. The match id is derived from the opening position. An
    improvement in resolution would split some of these matches, e.g.,

      [+1, +1, -1, -1] --> [+1, -1], [-1, -1]
      [+2, -1, -2, +1] --> [+2, -1, -1], [-1, +1]
