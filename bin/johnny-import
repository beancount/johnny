"""Import new transactions from sources into our local database.

This tool reads a configuration file with a specification for transactions and
positions input sources for each account, normalizes them, runs the chains
processing code and ingests them everything to its own local database of
normalized and matched transactions. The local database is the source of data
for various tools, such as Johnny's trade log and eventually monitoring tools as
well. This is intended to be runnable mid-day.
