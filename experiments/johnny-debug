"""Command-line input file converter and printer for Johnny.

This tool
- Auto-detects all input sources and their types, from filenames and directories
  of files.
- Parses them, and normalizes them.
- Validates them.
- Prints out their contents on the command-line (or to a file).

This tool is also able to join transactions and positions and print out
aggregates at the chain (trade) level.

The purpose of this tool is to
- Make it straightforward to debug input file parsing and conversion,
- Work from the command-line.
